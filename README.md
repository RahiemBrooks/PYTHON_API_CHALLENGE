# PYTHON_API_CHALLENGE
To obtain information about the weather in the equator region, a Python program was developed using requests, APIs, and JSON traversals. 
This challenge led to the creation of two solutions: WeatherPy and VacationPy.
To ensure the security of the API keys for WeatherAPI and Geoapify, they were generated and stored in the api_keys.py file. 
This file was added to the .gitignore to prevent the keys from being publicly shared.
